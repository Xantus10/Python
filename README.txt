How to set up a game:
1. You can choose to run the game from terminal or just run it (in terminal you can insert ip address as argument)
2. One player needs to be the server and another one needs to be client
3. If you donÂ´t understand networking, then i will tell you - both players need to be in LAN (in most cases)
